# SMS Spam Classification
# Overview
This project focuses on classifying SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to build and evaluate models to accurately identify spam messages based on their content.

# Objective
To develop effective machine learning models for SMS spam classification, evaluate their performance using cross-validation, and compare the results of different algorithms.

# Libraries and Tools
NLTK: For text preprocessing, including stopwords removal and lemmatization.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing and evaluating machine learning models.
