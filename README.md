# SMS Spam Classification
# Overview
This project focuses on classifying SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to build and evaluate models to accurately identify spam messages based on their content.

# Objective
To develop effective machine learning models for SMS spam classification, evaluate their performance using cross-validation, and compare the results of different algorithms.

# Libraries and Tools
1. NLTK: For text preprocessing, including stopwords removal and lemmatization.
2. Scikit-Learn: For implementing and evaluating machine learning models.
# You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install nltk scikit-learn numpy pandas

# Model Training and Evaluation
We use two machine learning models for classification:

1. Naive Bayes: The MultinomialNB model is trained on the preprocessed data, and its performance is evaluated using cross-validation with the F1 score as the metric.
2. Decision Tree: The DecisionTreeClassifier is also trained and evaluated using the same cross-validation approach.
